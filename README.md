# Responsive Sidebar
### [Responsive Multicolor Sidebar Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k72Q9ltRlFw&ab_channel=LamaDev)

This project is for learning purposes. Tutorial that I followed was coded in HTML, CSS & JS, what I done was, I tool the code presented and re-coded all of it to be as a React project that utilised Styled-components library so it could be plugged in in any future personal projects as a stand alone component.

## Resouces
* `npx i create-react-app responsive-sidebar`
* `npm i styled-copmponents`
* `npm i @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons`
